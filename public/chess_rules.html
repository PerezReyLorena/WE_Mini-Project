        <h2>The Nature and Objectives of Chess</h2>
	  <p>The game of chess is played between two opponents who
    move pieces alternately on a square board called a chessboard.
    The player who has control of the white pieces (White) starts the
    game. A player is said to 'have the move', when the opponent's move
    has been completed.</p>
	  <p>The objective of each player is to arrive at a position such
    that the opponent's king has no legal move which would avoid the
    capture of the king on the following move. This situation is called
    checkmate and the player who checkmates his opponent wins the
    game. The player who has been checkmated loses the game.</p>

	  <h2>The Initial Position of the Pieces on the Chessboard</h2>
	  <p>
		The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal
alternating light and dark squares. The chessboard is placed between
the players in such a way that the near corner square to the
right of the player is a light square.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-colored
pieces (the white pieces); the other has 16 dark-colored pieces
(the black pieces). Each side has one king, one queen, two rooks,
two bishops, two knights and eight pawns.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as
follows where the following symbols represent the pieces.</p>

	  <p>
		The eight vertical columns of squares are referred to as
files. The eight horizontal rows of squares are referred to as ranks. A
straight line of squares of the same color, touching corner to corner,
is referred to as a diagonal.
	  </p>

	  <h2>The Moves of the Pieces</h2>
	  <p>
		No piece can be moved to a square occupied by a piece of
the same color (white or black). If a piece moves to a square occupied
by an opponent's piece the latter is captured and removed from
the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack a
square if the piece could move to that square on the next turn and
capture an opponent's piece if one occupies the square.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<ol type="a">
		<li>The queen moves to any square along the file, the rank
or a diagonal on which it stands.</li>
		<li>The rook moves to any square along the file or the rank on
which it stands.</li>
		<li>The bishop moves to any square along a diagonal on which
it stands.</li>
		When making these moves the queen, rook or bishop cannot
move over any intervening pieces.
		</ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The knight moves to one of the squares nearest to that on
which it stands but not on the same rank, file or diagonal.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The pawn has five legal moves:
		<ol type="a">
		<li>The pawn moves forward to the unoccupied square immediately
in front of it on the same file.</li>
		<li>On its first move each pawn may advance two squares along
the same file provided both squares are unoccupied.</li>
		<li>The pawn moves to a square occupied by an opponent's
piece which is diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing
that piece.</li>
		<li>A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent's pawn
which has advanced two squares in one move from its original square
may capture this opponent's pawn as though the latter had been
moved only one square. This capture can be made only on the move
following this advance and is called an 'en passant' capture.</li>
		<li>When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position
it must be exchanged as part of the same move for a queen,
rook, bishop or knight of the same color. The player's choice is not
restricted to pieces that have been captured previously. This exchange
of a pawn for another piece is called 'promotion' and the
effect of the new piece is immediate.</li>
		</ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The king can move in two different ways, by:
		<ol type="a">
		<li>moving to any adjoining square that is not attacked by one or
more of the opponent's pieces, provided that the king is not in check
at the conclusion of the move. The king is said to be in check, if it is
under attack by one or more of the opponent's pieces, even if those
opposing pieces cannot themselves move.</li>
		<li>castling. This is a move of the king and either rook of the
same color on the same rank, counting as a single move of the king
and executed as follows: the king is transferred from its original
square two squares towards the rook, then that rook is transferred
over the king to the square the king has just crossed.
Castling is illegal in the following situations:
		  <ol type="i">
		  <li>if the king has already been moved.</li>
		  <li>with a rook that has already been moved.</li>
		  <li>while the square on which the king stands, or the square
which it must cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked
by one or more of the opponent's pieces.</li>
		  <li>while there is any piece between the king and the rook with
which castling is to be effected.</li>
		  </ol>
		</li>

	  <h2>The Completed Game</h2>
        <ul class="uk-list">
		<li><phrase>The game is won by the player who has checkmated the
opponent's king with a legal move. This immediately ends the game.</phrase>
		<phrase>The game is won by the player whose opponent resigns.</phrase>
	  </li>
      <li>
		The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal
move and the king is not in check. The game is said to end in stalemate.
This immediately ends the game.
      </li>
	  <li>
		The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players
during the game. This immediately ends the game.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		The game may be drawn if the identical position is about to
appear or has appeared on the chessboard three times.
	  </li
	  <li>
		The game may be drawn if the last 50 consecutive moves
have been made by each player without the movement of any pawn
and without the capture of any piece.
	  </li>
